# YAPP_Box
Yet Another Parametric Projectbox generator

## THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS!!

See: <a href="https://willem.aandewiel.nl/index.php/2022/01/01/nog-een-geparameteriseerde-projectbox-generator/">This Post</a>

I have done my best but during the process of programming I somehow got the
idea that it can probably be done simpler. Specific the calculations for the
topPlane. So, if you think you can help please contact me or make a Pull
request.

## TO DO

* I want rounded corners! Do you have an idear howto do that??
* modules (Hooks) that can be (re)defined by the user (almost there ;-))
* screw connector between the top- and bottomPlanes (for bigger boxes)
* snap-ons in the ridges
* a lot more ..
